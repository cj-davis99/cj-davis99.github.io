# Webpage
This repository contains all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that my personal webpage uses. I am by no means a web designer and almost all of the code here comes from random Google searches. That said, I think it's fun to have a webpage that is fully mine, and I enjoy playing around with my formatting from time to time. 

The primary video series I used to create this webpage can be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB_8_iq1cL8MVeun7cB6eNc&si=187sawc9rlnnSGMI).
